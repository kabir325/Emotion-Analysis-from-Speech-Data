# üéµ Emotion Analysis from Speech Data ‚Äì Unsupervised Learning  
*Capstone Project 2: Building and Comparing ML/DL Models*  

## üìå Overview  
This project focuses on **emotion recognition from speech audio** using the **RAVDESS dataset**.  
The objective was to explore **unsupervised learning approaches** for clustering emotional states in speech without relying on explicit labels.  

Key highlights:  
- Extracted **comprehensive audio features** (MFCCs, spectral features, pitch, energy, tempo, chroma, mel spectrograms).  
- Applied multiple **clustering algorithms**: K-Means, DBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering, Gaussian Mixture Models, Spectral Clustering, and Ensemble Clustering.  
- Used **dimensionality reduction techniques** (PCA, t-SNE, TruncatedSVD) for visualization and noise reduction.  
- Evaluated clustering quality with **Silhouette Score, Calinski-Harabasz Index, and Davies-Bouldin Score**.  
- Built a **real-time emotion detection pipeline** for batch or single audio prediction.

## üìÇ Dataset  
- **RAVDESS (Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song)**  
- Contains speech recordings across 8 emotions: Neutral, Calm, Happy, Sad, Angry, Fearful, Disgust, Surprised.  
- Each file includes actor ID, emotion label, and modality in its filename.  
- Dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uwrfkaggler/ravdess-emotional-speech-audio) or directly from [RAVDESS official site](https://zenodo.org/record/1188976).
